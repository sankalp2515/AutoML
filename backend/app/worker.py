"""arq worker entrypoint (Phase 4, opt-in).

Run a dedicated worker container with:
    arq app.worker.WorkerSettings

It pulls run jobs off the Redis queue and executes the pipeline — decoupled from
the API process, so runs survive API restarts and scale horizontally. Only used
when USE_JOB_QUEUE=true; otherwise the API runs pipelines in-process.
