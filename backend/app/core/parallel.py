"""Parallel task execution with a Ray backend and a sequential fallback (Tower #1).

Independent ML work — training candidate models, evaluating hyperparameter trials —
is embarrassingly parallel. `parallel_map` fans those tasks out across a Ray cluster
when `USE_RAY` is on (and Ray is importable), and otherwise runs them sequentially.
The fallback means enabling Ray is a deliberate, separately-verified step that can
never break a run: if Ray is missing or `ray.init()` fails, we degrade to a plain loop.

`fn` must be a TOP-LEVEL (picklable) function and each item must be picklable, because
Ray ships them to worker processes.
